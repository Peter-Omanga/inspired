			<h3>My life Vision.</h3>	
				
				
				<p> For where there is no vision people <strong>perish</strong> Romans 29:18. 
				My greatest desire is to be a God fearing, responsible, accountable person in life.
				I'm looking forward to help develop my Community,
				Country and Nation by creating jobs and also reaching out to the
				less fortunate brothers and Sisters all over the world. May God help me.  </p>
