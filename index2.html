			<h3>How I came to Christ.</h3>	
				
				
				<p> Being born in a Christian 
					family, I thought that everything was ok. 
					I thought that I already had a ticket to Heaven. I used 
					to do bad things; being disobedient to my parents,
					telling lies all over. Untill this particular everning 
					when the Holy Spirit of God convicted me of my sins.Christ turned around my life and transformed me totally.
					This is the greatest joy in my he
					art that I would never want to let go just being called a child of God </p>
